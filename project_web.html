						<p style="margin-right:360px; height:253px;">One of our assignments in the module "Medieninformatik II" in our second semester was to build our own online portfolio to represent ourself and our projects to potential employers. <br><br>
                            Before I started to code anything, I wanted to make a rough sketch on my tablet, as you can see on the right side, what I imagine my portfolio would look like. 
							From the start I wanted to do a One-Pager and I did never change my mind on that. But I still wanted it to have a clear presentation while the visitor is able to switch easily between the content on it.  <br><br> 
                            After doing the sketch I decided what colour scheme I want. My wish was to have a colourful portfolio but the colours still have to be coherent. 
							I tried many layouts until I found one colour scheme on Pinterest that I instantly fell in love with.
                        </p>
                        <figure style="float: left; width:383px; height:972px;">
                            <img id="wireframe-pic" src="Medien/wireframe.png" style="float: left; width:383px; height:972px;" alt="Wireframe">
                            <figcaption>The wireframe in Adobe XD</figcaption>
                        </figure>
						
                        <p style="margin-left:395px; height:977px;">
                            After I had a sketch, a few notes on what I want on my website and the colour scheme I went to Adobe XD to create a wireframe, which you can see on the left, to put these three factors together and to have a rough layout of my portfolio.
							I loved the idea to use bright colours, they give off a summerly and happy vibe and I totally love that. They also represent my personality in some way and that makes this portfolio more special for me. 
							My intention was not to represent myself by my written words but also by the kind of way I structured and designed my website and what kind of message the visitor gets. <br><br>
                            Since the website is going to be a One-Pager I still wanted every section to be versatile. I decided for a beige background which you can see all over the page. Each section has a ”key colour” which is either going to be a coral tone or a yellowish orange. 
							For the headlines and text colours I used grey, white and black.
							In Adobe XD I was easily able to determine how I wanted to control my navigation and the structure of each section. 
							My vision was to welcome each visitor with a nice header picture and a northern German way to say “Hello”.<br><br>
							I also added a few things to animate the whole website a little bit.
							The navigation is fixed which means it stays in the same position no matter if the user scrolls up or down. 
							This was important for me since I wanted the user of website to easily click through every content that is on my page. Some points of the navigation have a sub navigation which means it is much easier for the user to see content they really want to see.<br><br>
							
							After I went through all these steps it was time for me to start coding. 
							I was happy that everything went according to my plan and I was easily able to create my website with HTML and CSS. 
							Since I also wanted a few special functions, it took some attempts to make them work the way I wanted them to. 
							It was very important to me have the navigation visible all the time and also to change the section by click on its point in the navigation. 
							With JavaScript it took me many attempts to get it right but, in the end, I was able to implement my desired function the way I planned to.<br><br>
                            In the end I was able to create the portfolio the exact way I designed it in Adobe XD but after editing a few times I realized that it does not work the way I wanted to because it tends to get confusing for the visitor or harder to edit. 
                            Which is why I decided to leave things out but still stick to its original design.

						<h5>Designing my own logo</h5>
						<p style="margin-right:180px; height:180px;">
							To make my portfolio look more professional I wanted to include my own logo on my website and also add as a Favicon in the address line of the Browser. 
							The origin of this design was quite random. During an exercise in my second semester, we had to work with letters. 
							It was my first idea when trying out different designs with various letters. 
							It did not fit into what we had to submit but I liked it so much that I saved it until this moment.<br>
							My idea was to use my initials which is “K” and “B” but make it “special” and not so obvious but still visible to the viewer’s eye. 
							That is how I ended up with the “B” having the same colour as the background of my portfolio. 
							The “K” sticks out very clearly but the “B” is still visible because of its contours.

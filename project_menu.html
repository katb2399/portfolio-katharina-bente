            <h3>Overlays and Menu Design</h3>
                        <p>This project was part of the module "Medieninformatik" in my second semester. The assignment was to create a game with Phaser 3 in a group of three people. In our group we decided to develop a Jump-And-Run-Game.
						One of my tasks was to do the overlays for different situations in the game and to design the main menu. <br>
						</p>
                        <figure style="float: right; width:400px; height:202px;">
                            <img id="switch-mainMenu" src="Medien/switch-mainMenu.png" style="float: right; width:400px; height:202px;" alt="Switch! Hauptmenü">
                            <figcaption>The main screen of our game</figcaption>
                        </figure>
						
                        <p style="margin-right:408px; height:207px;">To make our game more accessible for users I created a main menu, as seen on the right side, which shows up once the website has been opened. 
							From this screen the player can easily start the game, choose between the different levels, lookup the control of the game or take <br> a look at the credits. All of these functions are programmed as buttons.<br><br>
							We also decided to include a few buttons like one to switch the music on or off. I placed them in the right top corner. Apart from the main menu every screen in the game has also a home button to always get back to the main screen.<br> 
                        </p>
                        <figure>
                         <div id="switch-pictures">
							<img id="switch-gameOver" src="Medien/switch-gameOver.png" style="float: left; width:400px; height:202px;" alt="Switch! Game Over Screen">
							<img id="switch-levels" src="Medien/switch-levels.png" style="width:400px; height:202px;" alt="Switch! Levelauswahl">
							<img id="switch-winScreen" src="Medien/switch-winScreen.png" style="float: right; width:400px; height:202px;" alt="Switch! Game Over Screen"><br>	
						</div>
                        <figcaption>
                            The "Game Over" screen, the "Levels" screen and the "Win" screen
                        </figcaption> 
                        </figure>
						
                        <p>
							For our game I also designed a "Win" screen and a "Game Over" screen. The "Win" screen is set at the last station of the game, the "home" of the characters in this game. The player can now choose to play that game again or do go the home screen. The yellow colour of the word "Gewonnen" signalises that the player has won the game.<br>
							The "Game Over" screen is set at the first location of the game. The colour red signalises that the player has lost the game. They are now able to play again or to go back to the main screen. <br>
							In the middle of the three pictures you can see the screen where the player can choose between the different levels. Each level has the level's location as the background. That way the player can also choose based on the level's background if they want to play the level or not.
                        </p>
						<p>
							Lastly I created a logo to use as a favicon in the address line of the browser. For the creation of this logo we wanted to have a font that fits to the mood of our game. 
                            The player's task is to take three animals home before the darkness comes. Because once it is dark the ghosts come out and chase them with leads to the player losing the game. Over a course of three levels the player has to get these three pets home. 
							The reason we choose "Switch!" is because the player is able to switch between the three animals in the game. 
							We also build in a few obstacles which can only be overcome with one specific character.
